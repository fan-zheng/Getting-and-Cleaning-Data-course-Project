#  Code book expains the updated tidy data
## Main changes made for the tidy data according to Assignment requirement in bold:

**In this tidy dataset we only have columns that calculate Mean value and Standard deviation.
To make the variable readable, in the original variable names, all "t" at the very beginning is substituted
by "time", "f" at the beginning is substituted to frequency,"ACC" to "Accelerator",
"Gyro" to "Gyroscope","Mag" to "Magnitude".
For example, the original variable: tBodyAcc-mean()-X becomes timeBodyAccelerator-mean()-X.
Also adding two columns for activity label and subject label (column name:Activity_Labels and Participant) . 
Activity value is changed to be more descriptive, so instead of original "5", it is now "STANDING", the same for 
"1","2","3","4",and "6".
Also added "Paticipant" column and the number in that column corresponds to participant label from 1 to 30
means 30 people.
Then I calculate the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.So there is 30 times 6 rows
in the second tidy data frame called summary_train_test_sub.**

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and 
tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency 
of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration 
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.





The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
